# Tsunami Mitigation App

An Android application for displaying tsunami mitigation locations in Aceh.

## Overview

Developed during an internship at the Tsunami and Disaster Mitigation Research Center at Syiah Kuala University, this application provides information on over 100 tsunami mitigation places across 5 regencies in Aceh.

## Features

- **Interactive Map**: Visual representation of mitigation locations
- **Detailed Information**: Comprehensive data about each location
- **Offline Access**: Full functionality without internet connection
- **Navigation**: Directions to mitigation locations
- **Emergency Protocols**: Information on what to do during a tsunami warning

## Technical Details

- **Architecture**: MVVM pattern
- **Maps Integration**: Google Maps API with custom styling
- **GeoJSON Processing**: Custom parser for map shape data
- **Local Storage**: SQLite database for offline access
- **UI Design**: Material Design components with custom theming

## Challenges and Solutions

Converting complex GIS data into a format usable by the mobile application was a significant challenge. I developed a custom processing pipeline that converts GeoJSON data into optimized formats suitable for mobile rendering.

Ensuring the application remained functional during emergency situations (when network infrastructure might be compromised) required implementing a robust offline-first architecture with comprehensive local caching of all critical data.
