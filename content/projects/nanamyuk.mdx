# NANAMYUK

A plant watering management and recommender application built with Kotlin for Android.

## Overview

Designed and implemented in a 2-person team over the course of 1 month, NANAMYUK helps users manage their plants' watering schedules and provides recommendations for plant care.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system
- **Plant Management**: Add, edit, and remove plants from your collection
- **Watering Schedule**: Set and receive notifications for watering schedules
- **Plant Recommendations**: Get recommendations based on your preferences and environment
- **REST API Integration**: Consume data from a backend service using Retrofit

## Technical Details

- **Architecture**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **Networking**: Retrofit for API consumption
- **Local Storage**: Room Database for offline capabilities
- **Dependency Injection**: Koin
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Kotlin Coroutines
- **UI Components**: Material Design components and custom views

## Challenges and Solutions

One of the main challenges was implementing an efficient algorithm for plant recommendations based on multiple factors such as user location, climate, and user preferences. We solved this by creating a weighted scoring system that prioritizes different factors based on their importance.

Another challenge was ensuring the app worked offline. We implemented a robust caching strategy using Room Database to store essential data locally, allowing users to access their plant information even without an internet connection.
